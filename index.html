          The ocean covers over 70% of the earth's surface and provides a home
          for countless species of plants and animals. It is the source of life
          for billions of people around the world, but unfortunately, it is also
          under threat. In 2015, the United Nations established 17 Sustainable
          Development Goals, or SDGs, to address the most pressing issues facing
          our planet. One of these goals, SDG 6, focuses on ensuring access to
          clean water and sanitation for all. But this goal is about more than
          just human access to water - it also includes protecting marine life
          and their habitats. In this scrollytelling story, we will explore the
          current state of sea creatures and the potential future consequences
          if we do not take action to protect them.

          The world's oceans are facing unprecedented challenges due to human
          activities. Overfishing, pollution, climate change, and habitat
          destruction are just some of the major threats to marine life. Every
          year, an estimated 100 million sharks are killed for their fins, and
          plastic waste is choking our oceans and harming marine life. Oil
          spills and chemical pollution are also destroying coral reefs and
          other crucial habitats, leaving many species on the brink of
          extinction. The impacts of these threats are already being felt by
          many sea creatures. Some populations of fish, turtles, and whales have
          declined by over 90% in just the past few decades. Coral reefs, which
          are home to a quarter of all marine species, are disappearing at an
          alarming rate. And as the ocean's temperature rises, more and more
          species are struggling to survive.

          If we do not take action to protect our oceans and the creatures that
          live there, the consequences could be catastrophic. The loss of key
          species could have a ripple effect throughout the entire ocean
          ecosystem, leading to the collapse of fisheries and the loss of
          important sources of food for people around the world. Without healthy
          coral reefs, storm surges could devastate coastal communities, and the
          loss of biodiversity could result in the loss of potential medical
          breakthroughs and other benefits.
